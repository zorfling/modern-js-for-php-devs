One of my colleagues has been playing devil's advocate and hitting me variations of the following question for a week or two now.

His question, "Chris, jQuery is so quick and easy to get going, why would I possibly use something like React or Vue that has such a steep setup curve? And why wouldn't I just keep using jQuery anyway. There's nothing wrong with it!"

So there's a couple of questions in that, so I'll try here to break it down. I'll start with the latter.

## Why shouldn't I keep using jQuery?

So the bottom line here is, because you probably don't need it anymore. jQuery was born in an age of ES5, when it was truly difficult to maintain browser compatibility, when functional paradigms were the bastion of mad scientist types (I'm looking at you, Haskell devs!) and as JavaScript as a web language was growing from the dark old days of DHTML, where JavaScript was used for image rollovers, to a burgeoning new age of web application.

## jQuery is so quick, how can React or Vue compete, and why bother?
