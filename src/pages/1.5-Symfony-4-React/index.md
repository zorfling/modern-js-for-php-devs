In the last post, we introduced Webpack Encore and why it makes for a quick start for modern JS with Symfony.

In this post, we'll set up a basic starter repo for a React frontend using Symfony and Webpack Encore.

As a bonus, as Symfony 4 was just released on November 30th 2017, let's use the latest and greatest and start with that.

## Set up a new Symfony 4 project
using `$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-project`

## Configure Webpack Encore to add React
http://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html

## Set up a demo JSON API
What will we build? Just demo data?

## Set up a React frontend which uses it
Root node in twig

New react component

Webpack encore entrypoint
