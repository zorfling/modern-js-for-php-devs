In the last post, we introduced Webpack Encore and why it makes for a quick start for modern JS with Symfony.

In this post, we'll set up a basic starter repo for a React frontend using Symfony and Webpack Encore.

As a bonus, as Symfony 4 was just released on November 30th 2017, let's use the latest and greatest and start with that.

## Set up a new Symfony 4 project
I'll assume that you've got a basic understanding of composer and Symfony, but if not, go check out the [Symfony quick start](http://symfony.com/doc/current/quick_tour/the_big_picture.html).

Ready? Ok let's go!

`$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-project`
Tip: you'll need composer to be installed globally for this to work.

This will create a directory called `my-project`in the current directory with a Symfony skeleton site, and use composer to install all the dependencies.

## Configure Webpack Encore to add React
http://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html

## Set up a demo JSON API
What will we build? Just demo data?

## Set up a React frontend which uses it
Root node in twig

New react component

Webpack encore entrypoint

Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/zorfling/react-starter-symfony) to clone the finished starter repo.
